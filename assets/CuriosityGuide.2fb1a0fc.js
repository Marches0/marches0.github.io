You can enhance them during CS Curiosity for rarity rankings, and swap them out for a Purple+ during Power for a decent chunk of power with a small rarity gain. </p><p><h4>Improving</h4> It costs nine of the same quality Curiosity to increase the quality of one. Nine of a given quality is usually better than one of the next quality. <table class="table"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Level 50</th><th scope="col">Potential</th><th scope="col">Stats</th><th scope="col">Stat Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rare</td><td>196</td><td>7,620,490</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Unique</td><td>278</td><td>22,216,028</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Heirloom</td><td>600</td><td>39,771,140</td><td>6%</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><h4>Laddering</h4> Curiosity is unique in that it is moveable power - you can equip an item to a minister and later move it to another, as long as your overall power doesn&#39;t decrease. This is best taken advantage of for powering weak ministers pre-Clash, and then moving the curiosities onto your favoured ministers afterwards. </p><p><h4>Set Differences</h4> The main difference between each set (apart from some individual items having different combinations of stat bonuses) is that a curiosity that is improved to a higher quality will provide fewer stats than one that is &quot;naturally&quot; at that level. For example, at level 1: <table class="table"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Heirloom Item</th><th scope="col">Base Quality</th><th scope="col">Potential</th><th scope="col">Stats</th><th scope="col">Stat Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zhanlu Sword</td><td>Normal</td><td>44</td><td>1,792,367</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Enamel Incense Burner</td><td>Rare</td><td>48</td><td>1,946,556</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Phoenix-headed Harp</td><td>Unique</td><td>49</td><td>5,874,380</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Mystic Dragon Spear</td><td>Heirloom</td><td>56</td><td>6,675,432</td><td>6%</td></tr></tbody></table> For this reason, items from the lower quality sets (i.e. Mighty Weapons and Decent Luxury) are better used as improvement materials, rather than being improved themselves. </p><p><h4>Which to equip?</h4> The initial temptation is to equip each minister with a complete set of related curiosities, bit this is often a power loss. </p><p> Not only does the set effect only apply to Unique and Heirloom sets, but the set effect at Unique is very weak - 20 in all potential, and 2% in all stats. For less powerful ministers, it&#39;s usually more benefical to give them curiosities that complement their strengths, rather than a full set - three Com+Pol affinity curiosity items on a Com+Pol minister will often give more than a set of related curiosities. </p><p> Try swapping curiosities between your ministers to see how things change; your overall power can only go up (but the power for individual ministers can go down, so be mindful when moving them around). Note that since power can only go up, changes you make are often irreversible. </p>',9);function a(r,n){return o}var d=t(i,[["render",a]]);export{d as default};
