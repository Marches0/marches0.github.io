                                The majority of players will never win an event; this is the reality of a pay-to-win game. Rather than celebrating VIP 10s who win yet again (and lamenting your lack of success), you should set achievable goals that you want to hit (e.g. powering unique ministers, doing well in your favourite events), and celebrate those who hit theirs.

                                Calculate how many Painting Boxes you will receive on the third day, and have the sum of that and how many you have remaining on the second day be a multiple of 10 - this means you will spend less time using your boxes on the final day, and so will win the tiebreaker between people who have the same score as you (since the tiebreaker is "who reached that score first?").

                                For example, a 0.99 recharge + gold Painting Boxes + activeness reward Painting Boxes will give you 17 per day. If you end the second day with 3, you will have 20 on the third day after you gain all of your boxes - this means you can use all of your boxes in two 10x paints. This is faster than the alternative, which would be painting with 17 boxes; one 10x paint, and seven 1x paints.

                                    If you exit a map, the fish will be reset to their starting positions but your hook will remain in the same place.
