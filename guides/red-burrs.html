                                <p>
                                    When a Red Burr is created by a direct move (i.e. immediately after making a move), it will appear where you moved the burr to complete the 5x. When it is created by a combo (i.e. the moves that occur after your move, due to the holes created), it will appear in a different place.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To understand where it will appear, we need to define how a Red Burr is actually created.

                                <h5>Matches</h5>
                                <p>A <i>match</i> is three or more of the same type of ball that are next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.</p>

                                <h5>Chains</h5>
                                <p>A <i>chain</i> is two or more matches that intersect on a single ball.</p>

                                <p>In this case, the golds form a chain because there are two matches on a single ball (the reversed L-shape).</p>

                                <p>The silvers do because, as a neighbouring four-match sharing a ball with a three-match, they intersect on a single ball.</p>

                                <p>The purples do not, because they intersect on two - the centre purples.</p>

                                <h5>Red Burrs</h5>
                                <p>
                                    A Red Burr is created when a chain is created. The typical explanation is "it's five in a row but can also be an L or a plus". This definition, however, doesn't suffice for chains that are made up of more than two matches.
                                </p>

                                <p>For example, this is a board that came about by using a Switch Stone:</p>
                                <img src="./img/mohist/switch-stone-board.png">

                                <p>Going by the typical definition, you would expect many Red Burrs to be created. In reality, only two are, because there are only two chains here.</p>

                                <h5>Where do Red Burrs appear?</h5>
                                <p>For a given chain created by a combo, the Red Burr will appear at the <i>highest</i> ball of the entire chain. If there are many balls at the top, it will appear in the <i>leftmost</i> ball of that set.</p>

                                <p><i>Note: the "Red Burr appearing" animation plays while balls are falling, so it looks like it appears lower than it actually does.</i></p>
